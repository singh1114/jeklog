Jekyll blogs and not easy to create. You need to be a tech guy before you can create a blog using Jekyll. Along with that if you want to host the website using GitHub pages, you need to know a few more things like GitHub. Branches in GitHub and many more things.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

All those things have been made easy using[ JekLog](http://jeklog.com). JekLog is the web app&nbsp;which makes it easy to create a free website using Jekyll and GitHub pages. You just need to have a GitHub account to make your own website using Jekyll and GitHub pages. This way you can kick-start your career as a blogger. The advantage of using Jekyll, the static site generator is that it does not make use of database and other overheads that slows the user experience. This allows the people to read your content without any distraction and with ease.

&nbsp;

We have got a limited space on our servers which do not allow us to make an image uploading system directly to our servers. We have some plans of expanding our servers but till then we can make use of other services like which can host your images to some server and after that, you can use the link of the image on the blog on JekLog while writing the post. We recommend <a href="http://imgur.com" target="_blank">imgur</a> for the purpose.

&nbsp;

This post will tell you how exactly "__You can upload images to your blog on JekLog".__
