Hello everyone,

I am writing this post with a mindset that,

*   __It will help you to get a free blog with your own domain name.&nbsp;__
*   __It will help you to create a free blog with static site generator Jekyll and GitHub Pages.&nbsp;__
*   __It will answer the question: "How to start a blog or How to create a website for free?".__
*   __It will help you to kick-start your blogger career.__

&nbsp;

Finally, I was able to release the JekLog project after 2-3 months of extensive work. I got the idea to develop such an application when I was writing my blog using GitHub Pages. I have been using Jekyll and Github Pages for almost a year now. I know it's difficult to read and understand MarkDown for the beginners( I know it is easier than HTML but some people still can't write it). Before the use of JekLog application, I was just cloning my website's GitHub repo to my local, made changes by creating the post in MarkDown and pushed everything back to GitHub.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This was how normally I was posting on my GitHub blog, whose address, by the way, is&nbsp;[blog.ranvirsingh.me](http://blog.ranvirsingh.me).

&nbsp;

Now let's stop talking and make the official blog of JekLog.

&nbsp;

First of all, you need to browse to JekLog official website but even before that, you need to have a GitHub account with a verified e-mail address. Go to the official website and click on the "Try it Out!" button.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

After that, you will be redirected to the page where you can select whether you want to create a new GitHub account or you already have a GitHub account. If you don't have a GH account click on the second option.&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<img alt="JekLog registration page" src="https://imgur.com/0CElTr7.png" style="height:364px; width:640px"/>

&nbsp;

This will take you to the GitHub official website for the registration. Make sure when you come back you must have verified your email address.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Otherwise, if you have a GH account, you can directly click on the following button.

&nbsp;

<img alt="JekLog: Have a GH account" src="https://i.imgur.com/Mxdy97v.png" style="height:364px; width:640px"/>

&nbsp;

This will take you to the login option.

&nbsp;

<img alt="JekLog: Login using GitHub" src="https://i.imgur.com/1Qn1NOn.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:364px; width:640px"/>

&nbsp;

After that, you have to authorize your GitHub account.

&nbsp;

<img alt="JekLog: Authorize your GitHub account" src="https://i.imgur.com/BB6RB5L.png" style="height:364px; width:640px"/>

&nbsp;

Authorizing the application will take you to a page where you will ask to create a repository. On the right-hand side are all the repositories which you already have created in the past. If you are a new user then your repository list will be empty. Repo is the main entity in which your code will exist. __Choose a special name with no spaces in it and it should not match anything on the right-hand side.__

&nbsp;

<img alt="JekLog: create repo with repo list" src="https://i.imgur.com/2ZREcaC.png" style="height:364px; width:640px"/>

&nbsp;

If everything goes fine you will be redirected to the homepage which looks something like this.

&nbsp;

<img alt="Home page of JekLog" src="https://i.imgur.com/MlUNwuD.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:364px; width:640px"/>

&nbsp;

Now that you have successfully completed all these steps, there are a whole lot of things you can do with JekLog. Click on the user shaped button on the right-hand side to find all the available options.

&nbsp;

<img alt="JekLog options for users" src="https://i.imgur.com/t2zDmnc.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:364px; width:640px"/>

&nbsp;

Today I am going to demonstrate two things, first is to change to site profiles of your newly created blog.

### __Jekyll blog site profile__

For this, you need to choose the option of site profile from the user button as follows:

<img alt="JekLog change site profile" src="https://i.imgur.com/eJFLwOL.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:364px; width:640px"/>

This will take you to the JekLog's site profile page where you can fill your details. I am filling these details on my blog.

<img alt="JekLog fill site details" src="https://i.imgur.com/y31Vgvs.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:364px; width:640px"/>

You can leave the avatar option as it is if you want. Now I will show you how to add social profiles to your blog. There are a whole lot of options in this field. You need to choose the option to&nbsp;__connect social profiles.__

<img alt="JekLog connect social profiles" src="https://i.imgur.com/UaQRbVc.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:364px; width:640px"/>

I like to fill few of these options. You don't need to fill all these options. These are only present for the future use.

&nbsp;

After all this work you might want to see where is your newly created blog. Just find the last option in the user drop-down as&nbsp;visit your blog&nbsp;and click on it to find your blog.

&nbsp;

That's all for today, next time I will show you how to write posts on your blog which is very easy as well.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There are some bads in the web app. Feel free to share them over to the GitHub issues. Everything can be found on JekLog official website.&nbsp;
