Jekyll blogs and not easy to create. You need to be a technical&nbsp;guy before you can create a blog using Jekyll. Along with that if you want to host the website using GitHub pages, you need to know a few more things like GitHub, Branches in GitHub and similar advanced stuff. To upload an image to Jekyll blog is somewhat difficult as it the width of the image is not certain. If you want to upload an image to GitHub you will use the same criteria that you follow while pushing some code to GitHub. The full process of uploading an image to GitHub involves a total of three steps, which are:

    
    
    $ git add image_name.jpg
    $ git commit -m "Some special name"
    $ git push origin master
    
    

All those things have been made easy using[ JekLog](http://jeklog.com). JekLog is the web app&nbsp;which makes it easy to create a free website using Jekyll and GitHub pages. You just need to have a GitHub account to make your own website using Jekyll and GitHub pages. This way you can kick-start your career as a blogger. The advantage of using Jekyll, the static site generator is that it does not make use of database and other overheads that slows the user experience. This allows the people to read your content without any distraction and with great ease.

&nbsp;

First of all, let's discuss the advantage of using images on a blog:

## &nbsp;

## Advantage of using images on a blog

&nbsp;

### __Increasing social shares by uploading images to blog__

  
When we upload images to a blog post or a particular URL, social engines try to create a beautiful thumbnail by picking up some or all the images from the URL. When these images are tagged in for a particular post on a social media, they are definitely going to be liked by more people than the posts with no image.

&nbsp;

### __Longtime retention using images in blog posts__

&nbsp;

It is proven that human mind stores things in the form of images. So, if you show a lot of images in your post then, people will get what you want to tell them and they will keep the thing in their&nbsp;mind for a longer time.

&nbsp;

### __Increase Search Engine Optimization( SEO) __

### &nbsp;

Images can be a great source of generating leads from search engine traffic. I have talked about the ways in which we can optimize images for a blog. Please give a read to that post:&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.jeklog.com/how-to-do-minimum-seo-and-get-free-traffic-to-your-jekyll-blog/" target="_blank">How to do minimum SEO and get free traffic to your Jekyll blog </a>

&nbsp;

### __Visually appealing via images on the blog post__

### &nbsp;

No one can really argue with this point. We all know that images can be appealing in nature. It's always better to have a few images in the post. This always provides a better user experience.&nbsp;When we were kids we never read books with no images in it. We always wanted to read books with a lot of images in it. The same process works for the blog posts too.

&nbsp;

### __Increases Length of blog post__

### &nbsp;

And yes images are a good source to increase the length of the article and make it look like a beast. Increased length of an article can have major benefits in terms of the right-hand side ads.

&nbsp;

### __Better Explanation by images in Jekyll blog__

&nbsp;

Also, it is always better to explain things using images. Images stay in the brain for a longer time then any text can stay in there.

&nbsp;

We have got a limited space on our servers which do not allow us to make an image uploading system directly to our servers. We have some plans of expanding our servers but till then we can make use of other services like which can host your images to some server and after that, you can use the link of the image on the blog on JekLog while writing the post. We recommend <a href="http://imgur.com" target="_blank">imgur</a> for the purpose.

&nbsp;

This post will tell you how exactly "__You can upload images to your blog on JekLog".__
