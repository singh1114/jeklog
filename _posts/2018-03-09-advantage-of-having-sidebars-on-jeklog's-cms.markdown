We were thinking of doing it for a long time. We always wanted to add a sidebar for the users, so they can always see what they can do on many occasions. Therefore, we coded it in JekLog frontend and made it ready. Now, all the users who are creating Jekyll blogs on GitHub pages using JekLog will be able to use this amazing feature of sidebars.

Check out GIF, if you want to see the sidebar in action. Please share your views about the sidebar with us.

So as the post suggests we are going to discuss some of the benefits of having a sidebar. Well in most of the cases, you shouldn't be needing any kind of sidebar as they are very sidetracking. So, it's always a good option to give the user an option to close the sidebar. That is what we did with the JekLog CMS itself.

One of the greatest advantages of the sidebar is that we can __show the user, what they should be doing__ in an optimised way. Top navbars are the things which are always fixed and the most important for the user. For example, if you check the JekLog navbar, we always show a link to our blog, facebook, GH and many other things. These things according to us are very important. At the same time, we want to show all the available operations to the user.&nbsp;

__Sidebars are very great options to increase the engagement__. Increasing the customer engagement is a tough task. We can always keep on adding drops to the ocean just by using some basic tasks.&nbsp;

These all are the advantages of sidebars. Do share this article with your friends. Also, share your views using the comments.
