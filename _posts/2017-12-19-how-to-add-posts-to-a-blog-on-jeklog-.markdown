Hello everyone,

I am back with another post. In this post, I would discuss the very basic way of creating your first post using JekLog.&nbsp;

Say that you have created your blog by reading my earlier post -&nbsp;[How to create a free blog using GitHub Pages and&nbsp;Jekyll with JekLog](how-to-create-a-free-blog-using-github-pages-and-jekyll-with-jeklog/) .&nbsp;It's time to write something to your blog so that you can attract visitors and showcase your beautiful skill of writing. This part is rather easy to do.&nbsp;

You just have to choose __Add Post __option from the right-hand side of the webpage and you can add a post to your created repository/blog.

Now that you have reached the add post column, you can start writing your posts directly.

After the completion, you can submit the form. This will create a blog post on your blog. You can check it by clicking on __Visit my blog&nbsp;__ button.
